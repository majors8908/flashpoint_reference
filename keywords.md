### Acrobatic

This fighter displays great skill and flair when dealing death to their enemies, such that it is doubly demoralising to the teammates of the dead.

For scenarios in which Kills count towards the victory conditions (e.g. Slayer), each enemy killed by a model with this keyword counts as 2 Kills.

***

### Active Camouflage
Armour with this feature is more difficult to see due to the way it manipulates light.

If the model is targeted by a ranged attach, that attack is will not gain the Clear Shot +2 dice, High Ground +1 die, or Crouched +1 die modifiers if this model has fully charged Energy Shields.

***

### Blast

This weapon causes a large blast radius on detonation, which can even affect soldiers standing some distance away.

Before the damage and other effects of this weapon have been resolved, the models in all cubes adjacent to the explosion (in all directions) have 1 **Energy Shield** depleted.

***

### Continuous Fire

This weapon has an increased chance of damaging the enemy, but may overheat if fired for a prolonged period.

When a weapon with this keyword is used in a Ranged test, it benefits from **Weight of Fire (2).** At the end of the current **Shoot** action, the model that used the weapon must make a 3 dice **Survive (2)** test. If the test is failed, it takes 1 wound. Armour and Energy Shields do not protect against this damage. If this kills the model, the kill is awarded to the opposing player.

***

## Energy Shield (n)

Energy Shields are designed to absorb the energy of incoming attacks, whether this is from energy weapons or ballistic projectiles, melee combat, or falling off a building.
